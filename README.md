# iris_flower_classification_using_machine_learning



In the world of Machine Learning, classification is one of the most commonly used techniques. It is used to assign objects into one of several categories based on certain features. One interesting problem is to classify iris flowers into one of three species using their petal and sepal length. In this project, we will explore different Machine Learning models to classify iris flowers.






The first step in any project is to collect data. We will use the Iris dataset from Scikit Learn, which is a popular Machine Learning library in Python. This dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with their sepal and petal length and width, along with their corresponding species. We will use this dataset to train our models.






Next, we will analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships between the features and the species. We can visualize the data using scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots. This will provide insights into the distribution of the features and their correlation with the species.






Now we move on to modeling, where we will implement various Machine Learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. We will train each model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. This will help us choose the best model that can accurately classify iris flowers.






Finally, we will deploy our model into a production environment where it can classify any new iris flower based on its petal and sepal length. This can be achieved by creating a web application using Flask or Django, which will take input from the user and display the predicted species of the iris flower.






In conclusion, this project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to solve simple yet interesting classification problems like iris flower classification. It also highlights the importance of data analysis, model selection, and deployment in the Machine Learning pipeline.
